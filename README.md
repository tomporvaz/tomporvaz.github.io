*Where you can catch up on Tom Porvaznik's latest projects*

[Pomodoro Clock](https://tomporvaz.github.io/pomodoro-clock/) This pomodoro clock is a slick little app to help you focus on the task at hand and provide breaks at regular intervals.  This app was a joy to build as a fan of the pomodoro technique.

[Calculator](https://tomporvaz.github.io/calculator/) It adds, subtracts, multiplies and divides, passing state around like they're pigs in a blanket.

[Drum Machine](https://tomporvaz.github.io/drum-machine/) This simple drum machine lets you play sounds via the keyboard or by clicking the buttons.

[Hello World](https://tomporvaz.github.io/hello-world/) is my first page on github pages.

[Roman Quote Generator](https://tomporvaz.github.io/roman-quote-gen/) is my first React project I posted to github pages.

[Markdown Previewer](https://tomporvaz.github.io/markdown-previewer/) converts markdown to html as you type using the marke.js library.

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
